# BlueVibe Project Summary

## Overview

BlueVibe is a cross-platform mobile and web application built with React Native and Expo. It functions as a TikTok-like platform with a unique twist: instead of uploading videos directly, creators can embed videos from popular platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook) and enhance them with interactive surveys and quizzes.

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Authentication System**
   - User registration and login
   - Role-based access (Creator/Viewer)
   - Secure session management

2. **Video Embedding**
   - Support for multiple platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Facebook)
   - URL validation and parsing
   - Embed code generation

3. **Interactive Content**
   - Survey creation and display
   - Quiz creation and display
   - Timed overlays that pause video playback

4. **AI Integration**
   - Quiz generation from video transcripts using OpenAI

5. **User Interface**
   - Dark blue themed design
   - Responsive layouts for mobile and web
   - TikTok-style vertical scrolling feed

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- React Native with TypeScript
- Expo for cross-platform compatibility
- React Navigation for routing
- React Native Elements for UI components
- WebView for embedded video playback

### Backend
- Supabase for authentication, database, and storage
- PostgreSQL database with relational schema
- OpenAI API integration for AI-generated quizzes

### Database Schema
- Users (id, username, email, role, created_at)
- Videos (id, url, embed_code, creator_id, source, title, created_at)
- Surveys (id, video_id, question, timestamp, created_at)
- Survey Responses (id, survey_id, user_id, response, submitted_at)
- Quizzes (id, video_id, question, options, correct_answer, timestamp, is_ai_generated, created_at)
- Quiz Responses (id, quiz_id, user_id, response, is_correct, submitted_at)

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Screen Implementation**
   - Implement SurveyCreateScreen and QuizCreateScreen
   - Add user profile editing functionality

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for core functionality
   - Integration tests for API interactions
   - User testing on multiple devices

3. **Deployment**
   - Configure for production
   - Deploy to app stores (iOS, Android)
   - Set up web hosting

4. **Future Enhancements**
   - Analytics dashboard for creators
   - Social features (comments, likes)
   - Monetization options
   - Enhanced AI capabilities

## Conclusion

The BlueVibe application provides a unique platform for sharing and interacting with video content. By leveraging existing video platforms and adding interactive elements, it creates a new way for creators to engage with their audience through educational and interactive content.
